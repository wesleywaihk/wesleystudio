	<li>general rules
		<ol>
			<li>abandoned/postponed events:
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>unless a specific reference is made in the section that covers the sport, if any single event (match, game, race etc.) is not completed within 3 days of the original, scheduled completion date then all bets on the event will be void, except those on markets which have already been determined. the market must be fully determined for bets to stand for example, first half market, first player to score or time of the first goal bets will stand provided a goal has been scored at the time of abandonment.</li>
					<li>if any tournament or competition is not completed within 7 days of the original, scheduled completion date then all relevant markets will be settled based on the official result of the relevant governing body, provided the result is announced within 30 days of the original scheduled completion date.</li>
					<li>where a number of days are specified in relation to the completion of an event, the specific cut-off time would be 23:59:59 in the time zone where the event was scheduled to take place.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>venue changes and event durations:
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>see individual sports for rules regarding venue changes.</li>
					<li>if the scheduled duration of an event is changed before the event starts then all bets on the event will be void.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>dead heats:
				<p>if two or more selections finish in a dead heat in a market, the return for a winning back bet would be reduced. the reduction is calculated by multiplying the original stake by the number of expected winners and dividing it by the number of dead-heated selections. the total return is then calculated based on the reduced stake (i.e. the reduced stake at the original odds) with the net winnings being this amount less the original stake.</p> 

				<p>example 1: in a market where 3 selections dead heat for 1st place, a back bet on one of the winners for &pound;60 at 6.0 or 5/1 is settled as follows: the stake of &pound;60 is multiplied by the number of expected winners (1) and divided by the number of dead heated selections (3) to calculate the reduced stake (&pound;60 &times; 1/3 = &pound;20). the return is then the reduced stake at the original odds (&pound;20 &times; 5 = &pound;100). the net winnings are &pound;40 or the return (&pound;100) less the original stake (&pound;60).</p> 

				<p>example 2: take a market with 3 expected winning selections (e.g. horse racing place market), where 1 selection is an outright winner and 4 selections dead-heat for second place. once the outright winner has been settled, there are two remaining &lsquo;places&rsquo; in the market. a bet for &pound;60 at 6.0 or 5/1 on one of the 4 dead-heated selections is settled as follows, the stake of &pound;60 is multiplied by the expected number of winners (2) and divided by the number of dead heated selections (4) to calculate the reduced stake (&pound;60 &times; 2/4 = &pound;30). the return is then the reduced stake at the original odds (&pound;30 &times; 5 = &pound;150). the net winnings are &pound;90, or the return (&pound;150) less the original stake (&pound;60).</p>

	<li>soccer
		<ol>
			<li>samvobetbroker.com soccer bets are for 90 minutes play including injury time and stoppage time. extra time and penalties do not count unless otherwise stated.</li>
			<li>if any single event (match, game, race etc.) is not completed within 3 days of the original, scheduled completion date then all bets on the event will be void, except those on markets which have already been determined. the market must be fully determined for bets to stand for example, first half market, first player to score or time of the first goal bets will stand provided a goal has been scored at the time of abandonment.</li>
			<li>if the venue is changed, all bets will be void.</li>
			<li><strong>first/last goalscorer betting</strong> &ndash; own goals do not count for the purpose of first and last goal scorer betting. bets on &lsquo;first goalscorer&rsquo; will be void if the player fails to participate, or if the player comes on after the first goal has been scored. bets on &lsquo;last goalscorer&rsquo; are only void if the player fails to participate at any stage of the match. settlement will be on the player quoted as scoring by the press association and will not be changed if enquiries are made by official bodies.</li>
			<li><strong>half time betting</strong> &ndash all bets on half time betting will be void if the match is abandoned before half time.</li>
			<li><strong>corners &amp; yellow cards</strong> 
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>a yellow card counts as 1 point, a red card counts as 2 points. second yellow cards are ignored for settlement purposes (i.e. the maximum points total per player is 3 points).</li>
					<li>any markets that concern the occurrence of cards shown to players during a match are traded and settled by reference to all the available evidence, but are ultimately decided by the official result when available from the soccer authority responsible for organizing the match.</li>
					<li>any cards shown to non-players (e.g. managers or substitutes who are not on the field of play when they receive disciplinary action) or cards shown after the half time/full time whistle has been blown do not count towards the total.</li>
					<li>any corners awarded but not taken do not count towards the total. the handicap is applied to the final corner count for each team to determine the winner.</li>
					<li>in the event of a match being abandoned before 90 minutes have been played, all corners or yellow &amp; red card bets will be void, unless the settlement of the bet has already been determined.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>scorecasts betting</strong> 
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>first player to score/correct score double (scorecasts). all bets 90 minutes play only.</li>
					<li>bets will be accepted at a specially combined price. if a player takes the field after a goal has been scored or does not take part in the game, such bets will be settled as a single on the selected correct score at the appropriate odds. if a match is abandoned after a goal has been scored all bets will be settled as singles on the selected first goalscorer at the appropriate odds. should the first goal of the match be an own goal, bets will be settled on the next goalscorer and the correct score. if the only goals in the match are own goals, all bets will be settled as singles on the selected correct score at the appropriate odds.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>asian handicap betting</strong> 
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>in asian handicap betting, a handicap is assigned to each team in a match. the customer chooses which team to bet on, based on the available handicaps. at the end of the match, the handicap is added to the team that the customer has backed, and the bet is settled.</li>
					<li>bet example:<br/>
						ac milan vs. juventus.<br/>
						ac milan handicap = -0.5, odds = 2.00<br/>
						juventus handicap = +0.5, odds = 1.90<br/>
						assuming the final score of this match is ac milan 0:0 juventus:
						<ul style='margin:auto; padding:0px 0px 0px 40px'>
							<li>if the customer bets on ac milan, the handicap of -0.5 is added to the final ac milan score, making the final score including the handicap -0.5:0. this means that ac milan lose as a result of the handicap and the customer loses his bet.</li>
							<li>if the customer bets on juventus, the handicap of +0.5 is added to the final juventus score, making the final score including the handicap 0:+0.5. this means that juventus wins through the handicap and the punter wins his bet. the return for the bet is calculated using the odds offered, which is 1.90 (decimal) in this example.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>over/under betting</strong> 
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>the goal-line is the number of goals that we think will be scored in total in a particular match, expressed in a whole number (e.g. 2) or as a whole plus half number (e.g. 3.5).</li>
					<li>the line is either single (e.g. 2.5) or split (e.g. 2 / 2.5)</li>
					<li>you bet either over or under the goal-line.</li>
					<li>where the total number of goals equals the goal-line, stakes are refunded.</li>
					<li>normal 90 minute match betting rules apply.<br/>
						bet examples: 
						<ul style='margin:auto; padding:0px 0px 0px 40px'>
							<li>if you bet on &lsquo;over&rsquo; when the line is 3, you lose your bet if one or two goals are scored and win if more than 3 are scored. if exactly three goals are scored, your stake will be refunded.</li>
							<li>if you bet on &lsquo;under&rsquo; when the line is 2.5 and there are one or two goals in the game, your bet wins. if there are three or more, your bet loses</li>
							<li>a split line bet can be considered two separate bets since your stake is divided equally between the two lines.<br/>
								for example if you bet g10 on &lsquo;over&rsquo; when the line is 2 / 2.5 you are in fact betting g5 on over 2 and g5 on over 2.5.
								<ul style='margin:auto; padding:0px 0px 0px 40px'>
									<li>in this example, if the total number of goals is 0 or 1 your bet loses.</li>
									<li>if the total number of goals is 2 then half your bet is refunded (the 2 line) and half your bet loses (the 2.5 line).</li>
									<li>if the total number of goals is 3 or above then both parts of your bet win.</li>
								</ul>

				<p>this market works the same as traditional asian handicap and over/under, the above example is matching the saturday’s total english premiership goals against saturday’s total german bundesliga goals. where the bundesliga is giving a 3.5/4 ball head start, a bet on the bundesliga would require the total goals in the bundesliga to exceed that of the premiership by at least five goals for it to be a full winner, and by four goals for it to be a half winner.</p>
				<p>the over/under result is made up by adding all goals scored in both leagues.</p>
				<p>where a day is specified it will be the day in the country where the matches are being played, so total english premiership goals (saturday) will refer to all games played on the saturday in that specified league regardless of the time in other parts of the world. if a match is abandoned, postponed or suspended and not completed within the specified date, all bets will be void.</p>

			<li>all individual race markets are decided on the official result at the time of the ‘weigh-in’, regardless of subsequent amendments to the result. if a race is abandoned, or declared void, all bets on the race will be void. if a race is postponed and not run on its scheduled day, all bets will be void. if the venue or the surface (e.g. turf/dirt) for a race is changed after the market has been activated all bets will be void.</li>
			<li>in the event of a false start or similar incident resulting in a race being re-run, ‘under starters orders’ is negated and horses taking no part in the re-run will be treated as non-runners.</li>
			<li><strong>dead heat</strong><br/>
				<p>in the event of a dead-heat for first place in a race or event, the win stake of any bet on one of the selections involved in the dead-heat is divided by the number of dead-heaters and multiplied by the full win odds to calculate the return. therefore, for example, a ￡10 bet at 6/1 on a horse that dead-heats with one other horse for first place, is paid at the rate of ￡5 at 6/1, giving a total return of ￡35. the remainder of the stake money is lost. in the case of an each-way bet, where a dead-heat causes there to be more selections placed than the number of places on which we are paying, the number of selections dead-heating is divided by the number of places available. the place stake of the bet is divided by this number and then multiplied by the full place odds to calculate the returns.</p></li>
			<li><strong>ante-post</strong><br/>
				<p>ante post betting is deemed to finish at the final declaration stage. all bets on individual horses will stand whether the horse runs or not, unless the horse is balloted out or if the race is abandoned, declared void or the conditions of the race are altered. bets placed on horses after they have forfeited their entry at an entry stage or where they have not qualified by the qualifying date will be void unless that race has a later supplementary entry stage.in the event of horses being balloted out, the liabilities against the horses remaining wil be reduced at the rate announced in accordance with tattersalls’ rule 4(c).</p>
				<p>if a race is officially abandoned, declared void or the conditions of the race are altered all bets will be void.</p>
				<p>if a race is postponed, but run at the same venue within 7 days of the original scheduled date, all bets will stand provided the conditions of the race remain the same and the entries are not re-opened.</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>place markets</strong><br/>
				<p>the possible number of ‘placed’ or winning selections in a market is stated above the individual market and is determined by the number of declared runners when the market is being setup. any further non-runners will affect the number of ‘places’ in a market. if the number of potential winners, as stated above the market, is equal to or greater than the number of runners, all bets on this market will be void. if the number of ‘placed’ horses in a race is less than the number of potential winners listed, the winning selections will only be the placed horse or horses.</p>
				<p>markets will be settled as follows:<br/>
					3-7 runners: 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup><br/>
					non-handicaps<br/>
					8 or more runners: 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> unless stated within the market information or by the operator before the bet is placed.<br/>

					8-15 runners: 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> unless stated within the market information or by the operator before the bet is placed.<br/>

			</li>
			<li><strong>each way markets</strong><br/>
				<p>the place element of your each way bet will be settled according to the number of ‘places’ stated above the market. the number of ‘places’ in an each way market is based on the number of selections that participate in a race and can be affected by non-runners. in the event of there being less than five runners in the race all bets will be void.</p>

			when prices are offered to win a competition, bets accepted before the draw for the penultimate round (semi-final) has been made will be on an &lsquo;all in run or not&rsquo; basis, and non-runners will be treated as losers. bets accepted at prices issued after the draw for the penultimate round (semi-final) but prior to the draw for the final will not be subject to ante-post rules, and any non-runner will be treated as void for settlement purposes. tattersalls&acute; rule 4 (c) will apply to bets on the remaining greyhounds, with the amount of the deduction based on the price of the withdrawn greyhound at the time that the bet was struck. when a greyhound is withdrawn after the draw for the final is made all bets struck after the draw but prior to withdrawal at our prices will be settled at starting price, and bets on the withdrawn greyhound will be void. bets are accepted at the following venues licensed by the greyhound board of great britain:

		<p>throughout these rules, any reference to b.a.g.s. (the bookmakers afternoon greyhound service) should be deemed to include b.e.g.s. (the evening service).</p>
		<p>we do not accept greyhound placers.</p>
		<p>for greyhound racing abroad bets are only accepted for meetings covered by a full service on sis/turf tv and where we specifically advertise acceptance.</p>
		<p>markets will be settled as follows:<br/> 
			2-4 runners &ndash; win only<br/> 
			5-7 runners &ndash; 1/4 odds, 1, 2<br/> 
			8+ runners &ndash; 1/5 odds, 1, 2, 3</p> 
		<p><strong>favourites</strong><br/>
			 In any race, the favourite is the horse quoted in the official Starting Price return at the shortest odds; the second favourite is the horse quoted at the next shortest odds and so on. If two horses should be quoted at the same odds and if these odds should be shorter than those quoted against any other horse, then these two horses are the joint first and second favourites.<br/>
			 Subject to the foreign racing rules, where a customer uses the term &lsquo;Favourite&rsquo; or &lsquo;Second Favourite&rsquo; to indicate the selection, the stake will be invested on the horse defined in the preceding section; if two or more horses are thus selected the stake will be divided and invested equally amongst each of the selected horses. However, if such joint favourites are returned at a price whereby, irrespective of result, no profit could accrue to a backer of the favourite, the unnamed favourite will be treated as a non-runner. This section and the one preceding will apply equally to greyhound racing.<br/>
			 Starting price bets for unnamed favourites, or additionally in the case of horse racing for unnamed second or third favourites, are acceptable win only. If each way is taken in error, the bet will be settled all up to win.<br/>
			 Bets for unnamed second or third favourites in Greyhound races are not acceptable and if taken in error will be void.</p>
		<p><strong>Non Runners, Late withdrawals and re-run races</strong><br/>
			Unless a bet has been placed under ante post terms, when a selection is made void or does not run, then in single bets the stake will be returned. In accumulative bets the stake will run on to the remaining selection(s) with a double becoming a single, a treble becoming a double and so on. Unless a specific reference is made in the individual section that covers the sport, abandoned or postponed events are void unless they are re-arranged and take place in the same week (Monday to Monday local time). However, bets in markets that have already been resolved at the time of abandonment, such as first touchdown scorer etc. will stand.<br/>

			in the event of two or more horses being withdrawn before coming under starter&acute;s orders, the total deduction will be the sum of the individual deductions, up to a maximum of 90 pence in the pound.</p>	
		<p>in the event of a race being re-run, all bets will stand for the re-run race, with bets being settled at the prices quoted or returned for the original race. horses which came under starters orders in the original race will be considered losers if not taking part in the re-run race.<br/>
			horses &nbash; early prices<br />
			the tattersalls&acute; rule 4 (c) deduction scale will be applied to bet settlement when horses quoted in our early prices are withdrawn before coming under starter&acute;s orders. in such circumstances, the appropriate level of deduction will be determined by reference to the prices on offer at the time that the bet was placed.<br />
			greyhounds<br />
			when a greyhound is withdrawn:-<br />
			all bets struck at displayed prices prior to the withdrawal, and not cancelled by the customer, will be settled at starting price. in the event of a no race being re-run, all bets for that race stand at starting price for the re-run race unless previously cancelled by the customer.<br />
			all bets struck prior to withdrawal at our prices on individual heats or one off races will be settled at starting price, and bets on the withdrawn greyhound will be void<br />
			see rules for ante-post bets on a greyhound to win a competition. sports betting<br />
			we reserve the right to apply a rule 4 deduction to outright bets on sporting events when a player, contestant or team is withdrawn from the betting after having been declared to play. for betting purposes we consider a player to have been declared to play if he is included in a first round draw (for sports like tennis, snooker and darts) or its equivalent in other sports.</p>
		<p><strong>walkovers, cancelled and postponed races</strong><br/>
			walkovers void and cancelled races count as races. unless otherwise provided for in the section concerning ante-post betting, any selection involved in a race that is postponed until a later date, or abandoned, will be treated as a non-runner.<br/>
			where a race is postponed and run later the same day, all bets placed prior to the announced postponement will stand for the rearranged times unless previously cancelled by the customer.</p>
		<p><strong>forecasts</strong><br/>
			subject to the following rules, forecasts are acceptable in singles, doubles and trebles only. accumulators are acceptable only as part of a forecast bet special package as advertised from this shop. if otherwise taken in error they are settled as trebles, with the stakes being equally divided.<br/>
			if a single forecast should contain a non-runner this will be settled as a voided bet and the stake will be returned to the customer.<br/>
			unnamed first favourites with a named selection race card number or trap number are acceptable in forecast single bets. any such selection included in forecast doubles, trebles and accumulators (or tricasts) is void. should the first favourite and the named selection or trap number be the same, the forecast is void. in the case of joint first favourites the bet will be settled proportionately and, if one of the joint favourites is the same as the named selection or trap number, then that part of the bet will be void.<br/>
			horses<br/>
			computer straight forecasts are acceptable only in races of three or more runners. however, should a bet be accepted in error on a 2 horse race, or a race be reduced to only 2 runners, then computer straight forecast bets will stand, and be settled as a single, at starting price, on the horse named to finish first. similarly, in computer straight forecasts in which only one selection is made, or in races in which one horse finishes alone, bets will be settled as s.p. singles. if for some other reason no computer straight forecast is declared, bets will be settled on the tote exacta returns. if neither is returned, forecast bets will be void for settlement purposes.<br/>
			greyhounds<br/>
			forecasts are acceptable only in races of 3 or more runners. however, should a bet be accepted in error on a 2 greyhound race, or a race be reduced to 2 runners, forecast bets will stand, and be settled as a single, at starting price, on the greyhound named to finish first.<br/>
			straight forecasts are settled in accordance with greyhound computer forecast returns. dual forecasts are acceptable only in trebles for any three races at greyhound meetings not precluded by our rules. the dual forecast dividend is calculated as one half of the greyhound computer forecast, returned for each leg of the treble. if due to abandonment, no-race, or a forecast being invalidated for any other reason, a dual forecast bet is reduced to less than a treble, it is settled on the races remaining in that treble.<br/>
			in all circumstances where the greyhound computer forecasts are not declared settlement will be based on the n.s.l. straight forecast chart (dual forecast one half of the chart return).<br/>
			forecasts specifying tote returns, if taken in error, are settled at computer straight forecast returns or n.s.l. straight forecast returns where appropriate.<br/>
			instructions for a selection &lsquo;with the field&rsquo; or a selection &lsquo;against the field&rsquo; mean in both cases that the selection is required to win. instructions &lsquo;the field with&rsquo; a selection or &lsquo;the field against&rsquo; a selection means in both cases that the selection is required to be second.</p>
		<p><strong>tricasts</strong><br/>
			Greyhound racing &ndash; We accept Tricasts on all races where 6 or more runners actually run. Horse racing &ndash; We accept Tricast bets on all Handicap, Nursery and Rated Stakes Handicap races where 8 or more runners are declared and 6 or more actually run.<br/>
			Tricasts, for selections to finish 1st, 2nd and 3rd in correct order, are acceptable in races for which an official Tricast return is declared. Selections may be named, although race card numbers (horses) or trap numbers (greyhounds) will be taken, provided there can be only one interpretation of the required selections.<br/>
			If you have a non-runner in a tricast bet, your bet is settled as a forecast on the remaining selections in the order they were selected.<br/>
			For example: &pound;1 Tricast A &ndash; B &ndash; C, where B is a non-runner, will be settled as a &pound;1 forecast A &ndash; C.<br/>
			Combination bets follow the same rules, with each combination settled separately.<br/>
			Tricasts will be settled in accordance with the official Tricast return.<br/>
			Should selections for a tricast include one non-runner, the stake will be voided and returned to the customer.<br/>
			If, for any reason, a Tricast is taken for a race for which an official Tricast return is not declared, settlement will be made as follows:&ndash;<br/>
			Where all three selections run, settlement will be made as a Computer Straight Forecast on the selections nominated to finish 1st and 2nd, with the selection for 3rd place being discounted. For the purpose of combination bets the stake will be invested as a full cover Combination Forecast Bet.</p>
