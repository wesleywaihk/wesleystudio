				<p>yes, we aim to resolve customers&acute; complaints with our first response and are determined to strictly follow the guidelines set by our licensing body: alderney gambling control commission.</p>
				<p>there are occasions where a customer may feel so aggrieved with a particular experience that they feel the need to speak to a senior manager or managing director directly. whilst we will always endeavor to consider these requests, we would ask our customers to contact their assigned betbroker and our customer service team in the first instance in order to give us the opportunity to deal with their complaint in a consistent manner.</p>
