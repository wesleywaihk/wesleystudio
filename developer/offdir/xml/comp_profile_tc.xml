The company focuses its research primarily on drugs with demonstrated safety and efficacy, which through their current delivery forms have certain bioavailability, or therapeutic limitations that may be improved with sublingual or nasally delivery system. By optimizing CDE’s transmucosal drug delivery platform, our technology will reveal the full potential of sublingual and intranasal medication. Our technology platform differentiates existing pharmaceutical products, making new indications possible and provides proprietary protection, thereby reducing competition from manufacturers of generic drugs.

Our design team started the first Serial ATA project in the industry and created Serial ATA products that dominate the market. Our team also designed ECC blocks that have been incorporated in hundreds of millions of products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serial ATA is based on, and improved from, parallel ATA. While parallel ATA is an industry standard, there are many deviations from the specification. Serial ATA inherits these deviations. Our knowledge on the subject enables us to support these deviations so that our designs are compatible with most devices and hosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On RAID, our team's focus is to maximise bandwidth utilisation. Upon a disk failure, the disk must be replaced and rebuilt quickly so that the system can recover before a catastrophic second disk failure. Certain bandwidth of the storage system will be used for the rebuild process. Our architecture allows multiple disk failures. The urgency to rebuild is little and the bandwidth for rebuilding can be greatly reduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Product&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Happy Success' initial products include an AHCI Serial ATA core and a set of RAID cores. The AHCI Serial ATA core is compliant with ACHI Revision 1.1 and can also support legacy ATA task file accesses. It includes the AHCI and Serial ATA Link and Transport functions. The RAID cores support multiple disk failures in hardware.</profile></company><company><name>HealthBaby Biotech (Hong Kong) Co.Ltd</name><industry>不詳</industry><logo>/</logo><location>Unit 103,105 and 106, &116, 1/F, No. 2 Science Park West Avenue, Bio-Informatics Centre, Hong Kong Science Park, Shatin, N.T</location><person>Mr. Kenneth Huang</person><tel>3529 2396</tel><fax>3529 2396</fax><url>/</url><email>kennethw@healthbanks.com.tw</email><profile>/</profile></company><company><name>Hipro Hong Kong Limited</name><industry>電子工程</industry><logo>/</logo><location>Unit G07, G/F & Unit 301-307, 317-320 & 322, 3/F, No.5 Science Park West Avenue, Hong Kong Science Park, Shatin, N.T.</location><person>/</person><tel>/</tel><fax>/</fax><url>http://www.hipro.com.hk</url><email>/</email><profile>/</profile></company><company><name>Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute Company Limited</name><industry>電子工程</industry><logo>/</logo><location>Unit 101-120, 1/F & 507-520, 5/F, Photonics Centre, No.2 Science Park East Avenue &, Unit 301-315, Bio-Informatics Centre, No.2 Science Park West Avenue, Hong Kong Science Park, Shatin, N.T.</location><person>/</person><tel>(852) 3406-2800</tel><fax>(852) 3406-2801</fax><url>http://www.astri.org</url><email>corporate@astri.org</email><profile>/</profile></company><company><name>Hong Kong Integrated Circuit (IC) Development Suport Centre</name><industry>電子工程</industry><logo>/</logo><location>G/F, IC Development Centre, No.6 Science Park West Avenue, Hong Kong Science Park, Shatin, N.T.</location><person>/</person><tel>/</tel><fax>/</fax><url>/</url><email>/</email><profile>/</profile></company><company><name>Hong Kong Jockey Club Institute of Chinese Medicine Ltd.</name><industry>生物科技</industry><logo>/</logo><location>Unit 703, 7/F, BioInformatics Centre, No.2 Science Park West Avenue, Hong Kong Science Park, Shatin, N.T.</location><person>/</person><tel>(852) 3551-7300</tel><fax>(852) 3551-7333</fax><url>http://www.hkjcicm.org</url><email>sfhui@hkjcicm.org</email><profile>/</profile></company><company><name>Hong Kong Microelectronics Company Limited</name><industry>電子工程</industry><logo>Microelectronics.gif</logo><location>Unit 205, 2/F, No.5 Science Park West Avenue, Hong Kong Science Park, Shatin, N.T.</location><person>Mr. Song Hong Vong</person><tel>(852) 3421-0420</tel><fax>(852) 2384-8456</fax><url>http://www.hkmicro.com</url><email>songvong@hkmicro.com</email><profile>Hong Kong Microelectronics is an analog IC design company.

In TV applications, VP Technology enhances the video quality while minimizing the saw-tooth artefacts in moving pictures resulted from the de-interlacing process. 
In mobile applications, VP displays in QVGA and VGA resolution can be respectively incorporated into a tiny display of 1.6" and 2.0” diagonal for unmatched picture and video quality in 2.5G – 3G mobile phone display applications in MMS, Camera and TV mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VP technology finds its place also in digital camera, PDA, projector, near-to-eye microdisplay and personal TV displays in airplanes, trains, boats, cars and home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our vision is to make the display world more enjoyable and affordable.</profile></company><company><name>Vascular and Interventional Radiology Foundation</name><industry>不詳</industry><logo>/</logo><location>Unit 108, 1/F, Building 6, Bio-Informatics Centre, No.2 Science Park West Avenue, Hong Kong Science Park, Shatin, N.T</location><person>Dr. Simon C.H.
